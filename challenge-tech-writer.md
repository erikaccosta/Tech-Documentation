# About us
Croct is a **SaaS platform** that provides technology for real-time personalization. We provide unified, managed customer data to marketers, product managers and software engineers to generate insights, rotate resources that can meet each customer's unique needs, and monetize timely and relevant messaging.
By working with Croct, companies can make the most of their primary customer data to create a positive customer experience and increase their ROI.

# Overview
Croct's SaaS platform is designed for developers and allows them to focus on building products rather than expensive customization infrastructure. Thus, we provide a great experience for developers on any platform and framework. We currently provide a [JavaScript-only SDK](https://github.com/croct-tech/plug-js/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md), but we are working on supporting iOS and Android.

## You're not a developer but you work with data?
No problem! With that in mind, we created a programming language for non-developers! We call this **language CQL - Contextual Query Language**. It is an intuitive query language that allows anyone, even those who have never touched code before, to query information and make decisions without dealing with code and data processing. Visit [CQL Language]() to learn more.

# Implement solution
The solution implementation process follows three steps:
1. Data collection: in this step, gather all the information that will feed the personalization engine.
1. Definition of personalization strategy and metrics: in this step, define: the audience, the type of event (whether it will be an experiment or not), what will be personalized and which metrics can help measure the result of the personalization.
1. Implementation: implement personalization and tracking to measure results. To make getting started easier, go to the language-based start guide:
